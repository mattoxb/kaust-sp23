To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability

([DRES](https://www.disability.illinois.edu/)) and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or

## Emergency Response Recommendations {#emergency-response-recommendations}

The university police have posted some [emergency response recommendations](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/). I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building
[floor plans website](http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/)

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?

worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric
services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone
