Sometimes you need something a bit more powerful than a spreadsheet.  For most people, this means doing everything by hand.  But for you we have better things in mind.
You will be able to use the computer to get some real things done.  You will be able to:

-   Read data from a file and have the computer analyze if for you.
-   Create a web site complete with interactive forms and a database to remember what happened.
-   Create visualizations to understand phenomena or to convince other people to take action.
-   Perform scientific computations in other classes such as Physics.
-   Solve programming puzzles by learning competitive programming practices.
