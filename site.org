Sometimes you need something a bit more powerful than a spreadsheet.  For most people, this means doing everything by hand.  But for you we have better things in mind.
You will be able to use the computer to get some real things done.  You will be able to:

- Read data from a file and have the computer analyze if for you.
- Create a web site complete with interactive forms and a database to remember what happened.
- Create visualizations to understand phenomena or to convince other people to take action.
- Perform scientific computations in other classes such as Physics.
- Solve programming puzzles by learning competitive programming practices.

  - Instructor: Mattox Beckman
  - Office Hours: tba

*** Objectives and Outcomes

Upon successfully completing this course, you will be able to program in Python and use it to perform many kinds of tasks.
You won't be an expert at programming, but you will have the skills to learn new things when you need them.

*** Class Structure

The class meets twice a week.  The beginning of the class will have a short group activity based on the POGIL methodology.
Afterwards, the professor will show you a coding demo and give you a short problem to work on with your group.

*** Assignments and Grading

- There will be 10 homework sets, collectively worth 70% of the grade.  They will typically be released on Thursday at the end of class,
  and due in 12 days.
- Attendance will be worth 5%.
- There will be a final project worth 20%.  You will propose a topic to work on based on your own interests and skills.

*** Students with Disabilities

To obtain disability-related academic adjustments and/or auxiliary aids,
students with disabilities must contact the course instructor as soon as
possible. To insure that disability-related concerns are properly
addressed from the beginning, students with disabilities who require
assistance to participate in this class should contact disability
resources and educational services
([[https://www.disability.illinois.edu/)][DRES]] and see the instructor
as soon as possible. If you need accommodations for any sort of
disability, please speak to me after class, or make an appointment to
see me, or see me during my office hours. DRES provides students with
academic accommodations, access, and support services. To contact DRES
you may visit 1207 S. Oak St., Champaign, call 333-4603 (v/tdd), or
e-mail a message to [[mailto:disability@uiuc.edu][disability@uiuc.edu]].

*** Emergency Response Recommendations

The university police have posted some [[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency/][emergency response recommendations]]. I
encourage you to review this website and the campus building
[[http://police.illinois.edu/emergency-preparedness/building-emergency-action-plans/][floor plans website]]
within the first 10 days of class.

Of course, since we're all online, your classroom is likely your living space.  Have you considered making
a fire safety plan with your family or roommates?

*** Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)


Any student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to family
educational rights and privacy act (FERPA) should self-identify to the
instructor to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this
course. see the [[http://registrar.illinois.edu/ferpa][FERPA]] site for more information.

*** Mental Health

Diminished mental health, including significant stress, mood changes, excessive
worry, substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can
interfere with optimal academic performance, social development, and emotional
wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services
including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric
services, and specialized screenings at no additional cost. If you or someone
you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly
encouraged to contact or visit any of the University's resources provided below.
Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do -- for yourself and for those
who care about you.

Welcome to KAUST-UIUC Introduction to Programming!

Our objectives for this period:

- Introductions!  (Well, you all know each other, but I need to get to know you, and you need to get to know me!)
- Review the topics for this course
  - You can suggest topics too!
- Get a working version of Python on your computer via
  - local install
  - [[https://replit.com][repl.it]]
- Explore [[https://pogil.org][POGIL]] -- Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning
  - We'll have a real example next time!
